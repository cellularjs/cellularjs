## 1. About
Net is a component of CellularJS. It create a programmatic network where cell(same as service) can communicate with each others via a message flow. It use concept of "space" to relatively specify cell location and use appropriate driver for communication.

With the help of programmatic network, your services will become protocol-agnostic. No matter the driver use function call, HTTP, or AMQP, you will get the same message and your domain logic will be safe from protocol chaos. As a result, you can break your services up into multiple physical isolation services more easily.

By xxx, it make use of inversion of control to make things more beautifull.
