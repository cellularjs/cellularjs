# Worker
What if [virtual network](/docs/foundation/net/net-overview) and [worker_threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) message passing mechanism combine together? You can work with worker_threads in almost the same way virtual network work. `@cellularjs/worker` does not attempt to use thread for just a *single task*. Once net-worker is initialized, you can invoke any [service](/docs/foundation/net/service) that this net-worker exposed.

:::caution
***Multithreading is NOT always better***. When it come to performance, you should have some measurements. If your app don't have **CPU**-intense tasks, async is good enough.

## 1. Installation
```bash
yarn add @cellularjs/worker
```

Features:
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Integrated with @cellularjs/net(you can work with @cellularjs/di too).
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Request-response communication from main thread to child thread.
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Thread pool with fixed number of worker.
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Multiple thread pools.
- <input type='checkbox' /> You need more, please <a href='https://github.com/cellularjs/cellularjs/issues/new/choose'>tell me</a>?

:::note
To prevent communication deadlock, transferring message from child thread to other is not allowed.

## 2. Usage
### 2.1. Create pool of net-worker
*Example 1*: create a main network and a pool of 12 net-workers.
```ts {6,11}
// src/$gateway/http/index.ts
import { isMainThread } from 'worker_threads';
import { createNetWork, createPool, initNetWorker } from '@cellularjs/worker';
import { appNetwork } from '$share/network/app.net';

!isMainThread && initNetWorker(appNetwork);

isMainThread && (async () => {
  // For simplicity, in this example, we use current file as worker script.
  // You can make use of CellularJS CLI to create separate worker source.
  await createPool({ script: __filename, minThread: 12 });
  await createNetWork(appNetwork);

  // ...
})();
```

*Example 2*: create pool with custom name.
```ts {10}
// src/$gateway/http/index.ts
import { isMainThread } from 'worker_threads';
import { createNetWork, createPool, initNetWorker } from '@cellularjs/worker';
import { appNetwork } from '$share/network/app.net';

!isMainThread && initNetWorker(appNetwork);

isMainThread && (async () => {
  await createPool({
    name: 'halo',
    script: __filename,
    minThread: 12,
  });

  await createNetWork(appNetwork);

  // ...
})();
```

### 2.2. Transfer IRQ to net-worker
*Example 1*: transfer IRQ message to net-worker of default pool.
```ts {2,10}
import { IRQ } from '@cellularjs/net';
import { transfer } from '@cellularjs/worker';

(async () => {
  const cpuIntensiveTask = new IRQ(
    { to: 'Abc:Xyz' },
    { data: '...' },
  );

  const irs = await transfer(cpuIntensiveTask);
})();

```

*Example 2*: transfer IRQ message to net-worker of specific pool.
```ts {11}
import { IRQ } from '@cellularjs/net';
import { transfer } from '@cellularjs/worker';

(async () => {
  const cpuIntensiveTask = new IRQ(
    { to: 'Abc:Xyz' },
    { data: '...' },
  );

  const irs = await transfer(cpuIntensiveTask, {
    pool: 'halo',
  });
})();
```
