# Overview

## 1. What is it for?
What if [virtual network](/docs/foundation/net/net-overview) and [worker_threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) message passing mechanism combine together? You can work with worker_threads in almost the same way virtual network work. `@cellularjs/worker` does not attempt to use thread for just a *single task*. Once net-worker is initialized, you can invoke any [service](/docs/foundation/net/service) that this net-worker exposed.

:::caution
***Multithreading is NOT always better***. When it come to performance, you should have some measurements. If your app don't have **CPU**-intense tasks, async is good enough.

## 2. Installation
```bash
yarn add @cellularjs/worker
```

## 3. Features
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Integrated with @cellularjs/net(you can work with @cellularjs/di too).
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Request-response communication from main thread to child thread.
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Thread pool with fixed number of worker.
- <input type='checkbox' checked disabled /> Multiple thread pools.
- <input type='checkbox' /> You need more, please <a href='https://github.com/cellularjs/cellularjs/issues/new/choose'>tell me</a>?

:::note
To prevent communication deadlock, transferring message from child thread to other is not allowed.
