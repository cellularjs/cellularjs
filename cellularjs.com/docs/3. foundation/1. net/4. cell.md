# Cell
## 1. Overview
From architecture point of view, cell has different meaning from a class decorated by `@cell` decorator. This class is just a driver, you will learn more about driver in [virtual network](/docs/foundation/net/virtual-network) section.

Cell can represent for many things. It can be a domain, a bounded context, an aggregate root, a service(in term of microservices),... Overall, a cell look like a class(~object) - it can have data and [behaviour](/docs/foundation/net/service).

## 2. Cell decorator
A valid cell's driver  must be decorated by `@Cell` decorator. `@Cell` options includes:

### 2.1. Providers
Providers allow you to define how to create dependencies that can be [injected](/docs/foundation/dependency-injection/overview) into services of current cell.

**Example 1:** add providers into cell manually.
```ts
import { Cell } from "@cellular/net";

@Cell({
  providers: [
    { token: 'foo', useValue: 'bar' },
    { token: 'key', useFunc: () => 'value' },
  ],
})
export class User { }
```

**Example 2:** scanning folder for providers automatically. 
:::note
This function only work for class decorated by `@Injectable` decorator.
:::
```ts
import { Cell } from "@cellular/net";

@Cell({
  // scanning './data' folder for providers
  providers: ['./data'],
})
export class User { }
```

**Example 3:** using both manual and automatic method. 
```ts
import { Cell } from "@cellular/net";

@Cell({
  providers: [
    { token: 'foo', useValue: 'bar' },
    './data', // scanning './data' folder for providers
  ],
})
export class User { }
```

### 2.2. Imports
`imports` allow you to add [modules](/docs/foundation/dependency-injection/module) into current cell.

**Example:**
```ts
import { CommonModule } from '$share/modules/common';

@Cell({
  imports: [CommonModule],
})
export class User { }
```

### 2.3. Listen
`listen` allow you to register [services](/docs/foundation/net/service) into a cell. There are 2 way to register services into cell:

**Simple**, add services manually:
```ts
import { GetInfo } from './services/get-info';
import { EditInfo } from './services/edit-info';

@Cell({
  listen: {
    GetInfo,
    'EditInfoWithCustomName': EditInfo,
  },
})
export class User { }
```

**Or**, automatically scanning folder for services:
:::note
With this method, service class name will be used as a service name for sending request later.
:::
```ts
@Cell({
  listen: './services',
})
export class User { }
```
