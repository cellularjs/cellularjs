# Net overview
## 1. What it is
Net is a core component of CellularJS, it has responsibility to maintain virtual network where services can communicate with each others in protocol-agnostic manner. For example, instead of importing code directly from other cell, virtual network help your services communicate via a message flow, so it keep your code separate.

:::caution
CelluarJS is about programmatic isolation. It can't help you with something like **data separation**, what it can do is help you enforce _logical isolation_ by yourself.
:::

## 2. Installation
If you don't want to use CellularJs starter, you can install and use @cellularjs/net **independently**, or even integrate it into other framework(Of course that framework must support TypeScript).

```shell 
yarn add @cellularjs/net
```

Note: you need to enable typescript decorator to use this package. Adding `experimentalDecorators`, `emitDecoratorMetadata` to your tsconfig.json.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

__*Explain:*__
- `0`: In the initial phase, `$gateway` as home entry points will start your app. All cells in your network configuration will be added into virtual network and then you can use it later.
- `1` + `2` + `3`: These are external messages, it can come from any type of client(http, cli, other framework, library, ...). These messages won't go to service directly, but rather corresponding cell's gateway.
- `4`: Before sending message to service via virtual network, gateway will transform external message into internal message.
- `5`: Services receive internal request from virtual network and return internal response later.
- `6`: Cell/service can be used as internal cell/service without expose it to outside world via a gateway.

:::tip You should know
Behind the scenes, internal message transportation with *local driver* is just **a function call**, there is no request to internet, so don't be worried about speed,...
