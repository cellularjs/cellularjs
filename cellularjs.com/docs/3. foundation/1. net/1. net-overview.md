# Net overview
## 1. What it is
Net is a core component of CellularJS, it has responsibility to maintain virtual network where services can communicate with each others in protocol-agnostic manner. For example, instead of importing code directly from other cell, virtual network help your services communicate via a message flow, so it keep your code separate.

:::note
CelluarJS is about programmatic isolation. It can't help you with something like **data separation**, what it can do is help you enforce _logical isolation_ by yourself.
:::

## 2. Installation
If you don't want to use CellularJs starter, you can install and use @cellularjs/net **independently**, or even integrate it into other framework(Of course that framework must support TypeScript).

```shell 
yarn add @cellularjs/net
```

Note: you need to enable typescript decorator to use this package. Adding `experimentalDecorators`, `emitDecoratorMetadata` to your tsconfig.json.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

__*Explain:*__
- `1`: This is external message, it can come from any type of client(http, cli, other framework, library, ...).  
- `2.x`: `$gateway` as home entry points will transform external message into internal message and vice versa. `Virtual network` will _help_ routing internal message to the target service(cell).

:::tip You should know
Behind the scenes, internal message transportation with *local driver* is just **a function call**, there is no request to internet, so there's no need to worry about speed,...
